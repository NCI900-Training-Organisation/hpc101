Course Details
================

This course provides an introduction to High-Performance Computing (HPC) concepts, tools, and practices. 
It covers topics such as HPC architecture, connecting to remote systems, using schedulers, running parallel 
jobs, and leveraging GPUs. Participants will gain hands-on experience with tools like SSH, Git, and text 
editors, as well as practical exercises on transferring files, setting environment variables, and running 
jobs on an HPC cluster. The tutorial is structured into multiple sessions, each focusing on specific aspects 
of HPC, with real-world use cases and examples.
